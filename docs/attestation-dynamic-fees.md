# Dynamic Fee Schedule for Attestations

## Overview

The Veritasor attestation contract supports a dynamic, on-chain fee schedule that adjusts attestation costs based on **business tier** and **cumulative volume**. Fees are denominated in a configurable Soroban token (e.g. USDC) and collected atomically during each `submit_attestation` call.

When fees are not configured or are disabled, attestations remain free — preserving full backward compatibility with the original contract behavior.

## Economic Rationale

### Why tiered + volume-based pricing?

| Goal                    | Mechanism                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reward loyalty**      | Volume discounts reduce per-unit cost as usage grows                       |
| **Reward commitment**   | Tier discounts let enterprises negotiate better rates                      |
| **Predictable revenue** | Deterministic formula — no oracles, no off-chain state                     |
| **Fair compounding**    | Multiplicative (not additive) discounts preserve protocol revenue at scale |

A 20% tier discount combined with a 10% volume discount yields a 28% total discount (not 30%). This multiplicative model ensures the protocol retains more revenue than naive additive discounting while still rewarding both axes of loyalty.

### Why basis points?

All discounts use **basis points** (1 bps = 0.01%, 10 000 bps = 100%) to avoid floating-point arithmetic entirely. The fee formula uses only integer multiplication and division, making it deterministic and auditable on-chain.

## Fee Calculation

```
effective_fee = base_fee
    × (10 000 − tier_discount_bps)
    × (10 000 − volume_discount_bps)
    ÷ 100 000 000
```

### Worked example

| Parameter          | Value             |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Base fee           | 1 000 000 stroops |
| Business tier      | 1 (Professional)  |
| Tier 1 discount    | 2 000 bps (20%)   |
| Attestation count  | 12                |
| Volume bracket ≥10 | 1 000 bps (10%)   |

```
effective = 1 000 000 × (10 000 − 2 000) × (10 000 − 1 000) ÷ 100 000 000
         = 1 000 000 × 8 000 × 9 000 ÷ 100 000 000
         = 720 000 stroops
```

## Tier System

Businesses are assigned to tiers by the contract admin. Tiers are identified by `u32` level numbers:

| Tier | Name         | Typical discount                |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 0    | Standard     | 0% (default for all businesses) |
| 1    | Professional | 10–20%                          |
| 2    | Enterprise   | 30–50%                          |
| 3+   | Custom       | Admin-defined                   |

The scheme is open-ended — any `u32` tier level can be configured with a discount.

Unassigned businesses default to tier 0.

## Volume Discount Brackets

Volume discounts are defined as parallel vectors of thresholds and discounts:

```
thresholds: [10, 50, 100]
discounts:  [500, 1000, 2000]   (in basis points)
```

This means:

- 0–9 attestations: no volume discount
- 10–49 attestations: 5% volume discount
- 50–99 attestations: 10% volume discount
- 100+ attestations: 20% volume discount

Brackets are evaluated highest-threshold-first. The cumulative attestation count for a business is tracked on-chain and incremented on each successful submission.

## Configuration Guide

### 1. Deploy and initialize

```bash
# Deploy the WASM
stellar contract deploy --network testnet --source <KEY> \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/veritasor_attestation.wasm

# Initialize with admin address
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- initialize --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS>
```

### 2. Configure fees

```bash
# Set base fee of 1 USDC (7 decimals = 10_000_000)
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- configure_fees \
  --token <USDC_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --collector <FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --base_fee 10000000 \
  --enabled true
```

### 3. Set up tiers

```bash
# Professional tier: 15% discount
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- set_tier_discount --tier 1 --discount_bps 1500

# Enterprise tier: 30% discount
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- set_tier_discount --tier 2 --discount_bps 3000

# Assign a business to Professional tier
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- set_business_tier \
  --business <BUSINESS_ADDRESS> --tier 1
```

### 4. Set up volume brackets

```bash
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- set_volume_brackets \
  --thresholds '[10, 50, 100]' \
  --discounts '[500, 1000, 2000]'
```

## Security Properties

- **Admin-gated**: All fee and tier configuration requires admin authorization
- **One-time initialization**: `initialize` can only be called once
- **Input validation**: Discounts capped at 10 000 bps, thresholds must be ascending, base fee must be non-negative
- **Atomic fee collection**: Token transfer happens within `submit_attestation` — if the transfer fails (insufficient balance, no approval), the entire transaction reverts
- **Business authorization**: `submit_attestation` requires the business address to authorize, preventing unauthorized submissions

## Test Coverage

**61 tests** covering:

### Unit Tests (`dynamic_fees_test.rs`)

## Fee Toggle Backward Compatibility Test Matrix

### Backward Compatibility Guarantee

The attestation contract guarantees free attestations in two cases:

1. **No `FeeConfig` stored** — if `configure_fees` has never been called, `get_fee_quote` returns `0` and `submit_attestation` succeeds without requiring any token balance. The stored `fee_paid` field is `0`.

2. **`FeeConfig.enabled = false`** — if fees are explicitly disabled, the contract behaves identically to the no-config case regardless of what `base_fee`, `token`, or `collector` are set to.

This guarantee holds across all toggle state transitions and is validated by the test matrix.

### Fee Toggle State Transitions

The toggle state machine has three states:

```
         configure_fees(enabled=false)
              set_fee_enabled(false)
    +--------------------------------------+
    |                                      v
[No Config] --configure_fees--> [Enabled] <-> [Disabled]
                                           ^
              set_fee_enabled(true)        |
              configure_fees(enabled=true) |
    +--------------------------------------+
```

**Transition behavior:**

| Transition                                                                | Effect                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `[Enabled]` → `[Disabled]`                                                | Fees stop immediately on the next submission   |
| `[Disabled]` → `[Enabled]`                                                | Fees resume immediately on the next submission |
| No-op toggle (same value)                                                 | Behavior unchanged                             |
| `[No Config]` → `[Disabled]` via `configure_fees(enabled=false)`          | Config stored, attestations remain free        |
| `[Disabled]` → `[Enabled]` via `configure_fees(enabled=true, base_fee=X)` | Resumes with new `base_fee`                    |

### Volume Count Accumulation During Disabled Periods

A key behavioral invariant: **the business's cumulative attestation count increments on every successful `submit_attestation` call, regardless of whether fees are enabled.**

```
submit (enabled=true)  → fee collected, count++
submit (enabled=false) → fee = 0,       count++   ← count still increments
submit (enabled=true)  → fee uses total count (including free submissions)
```

This means:

- Businesses are not penalized for fee pauses — their volume discount progress is preserved.
- Businesses are not rewarded unfairly — free submissions count toward volume thresholds.
- When fees are re-enabled, the volume discount applied is based on the **total** cumulative count including all submissions made during the disabled period.

### DAO Config Override Precedence

When a DAO contract address is set via `set_dao(dao_address)`, the DAO-provided fee config takes precedence over the local `FeeConfig`:

| DAO state                                                   | Local config | Effective behavior                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| DAO set, returns `FeeConfig { enabled: false }`             | Any          | Free attestations                                           |
| DAO set, returns `FeeConfig { enabled: true, base_fee: X }` | Any          | Fees collected using DAO's `base_fee`, `token`, `collector` |
| DAO set, returns `None`                                     | Any          | Falls back to local `FeeConfig`                             |
| No DAO set                                                  | Any          | Uses local `FeeConfig`                                      |

The DAO override applies to both `get_fee_quote` and `submit_attestation`.
