# Replay Protection (Nonce-Based)

This document describes the **nonce-based replay protection** used in Veritasor contracts to prevent reuse of signed messages or encoded calls.

## Overview

- **Per-actor, per-channel nonces**: Each logical actor (e.g. admin, business, multisig owner) has independent nonce streams per *channel*. Channels separate different classes of operations (e.g. admin vs business vs multisig).
- **Strict increment**: The first valid nonce for any `(actor, channel)` is `0`. Each successful call must supply the *current* stored nonce; on success the stored value is incremented by 1.
- **No reuse or skip**: Reusing a nonce or supplying a nonce other than the current one causes the call to panic. Skipping nonces is not allowed.
- **Overflow**: At `u64::MAX` the contract panics to avoid wrapping.

## Storage Model

Replay state lives in each contract’s instance storage under a shared key shape:

- **Key**: `ReplayKey::Nonce(Address, u32)` — actor address and channel id.
- **Value**: `u64` — next expected nonce (i.e. the value the caller must supply on the next call).

The implementation is in `contracts/common/src/replay_protection.rs` and is reused by contracts that depend on `veritasor-common`.

## Attestation Contract: Channels and Entrypoints

The attestation contract defines three channels (see `NONCE_CHANNEL_*` in `contracts/attestation/src/lib.rs`):

| Channel constant              | Value | Actor / usage |
|------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| `NONCE_CHANNEL_ADMIN`        | 1     | Admin (or role-authorized caller) for admin operations |
| `NONCE_CHANNEL_BUSINESS`     | 2     | Business address for attestation submissions |
| `NONCE_CHANNEL_MULTISIG`     | 3     | Multisig owner (proposer, approver, rejecter, executor) |

**Admin channel (1)** is used for: `initialize`, `initialize_multisig`, `configure_fees`, `set_tier_discount`, `set_business_tier`, `set_volume_brackets`, `set_fee_enabled`, `configure_rate_limit`, `grant_role`, `revoke_role`, `pause`, `unpause`, `revoke_attestation`, `migrate_attestation`, and anomaly-related admin calls (`init`, `add_authorized_analytics`, `remove_authorized_analytics`). The *actor* is the address that authorizes the call (admin or role holder).

**Business channel (2)** is used for: `submit_attestation`, `submit_attestation_with_metadata`. The *actor* is the business address.

**Multisig channel (3)** is used for: `create_proposal`, `approve_proposal`, `reject_proposal`, `execute_proposal`. The *actor* is the multisig owner performing the action (proposer, approver, rejecter, or executor).

After `initialize(admin, 0)`, the next admin-channel nonce for `admin` is **1** (0 is consumed by `initialize`).

## Client Flow

1. **Query current nonce**  
   Call the contract’s replay-nonce view (e.g. `get_replay_nonce(actor, channel)`) to get the value the caller must supply on the next state-mutating call for that `(actor, channel)`.

2. **Submit the call**  
   Invoke the entrypoint with that nonce (and any other args). The contract calls `replay_protection::verify_and_increment_nonce(env, &actor, channel, nonce)` at the start of the call (after auth/role checks).

3. **Retry on nonce mismatch**  
   If the call fails with a nonce mismatch (e.g. another transaction used the same nonce first), query `get_replay_nonce` again and retry with the new value.

Clients must not reuse or skip nonces; they should always use the value returned by `get_replay_nonce` for the next call.

## Security Notes

- **Authorization**: Replay protection is applied in addition to normal auth (e.g. `require_auth`, role checks). The actor passed to replay protection should match the address that authorizes the call.
- **Channels**: Using separate channels (admin vs business vs multisig) keeps nonce streams independent so one class of operation cannot replay or block another.
- **Strict ordering**: Enforcing “current nonce only” prevents replay and enforces a single linear history per (actor, channel), at the cost of requiring clients to track or query the current nonce and retry on conflict.

## Integration with Access Control / Governance

- Admin and role-gated entrypoints use the **admin** channel; the actor is the caller (admin or role holder).
- Multisig entrypoints use the **multisig** channel; the actor is the multisig owner performing the action. This integrates with existing multisig auth so that each owner has their own nonce stream for multisig actions.

Other contracts (e.g. integration registry, audit log, revenue contracts) can adopt the same pattern by depending on `veritasor-common`, defining their own channel constants, and calling `verify_and_increment_nonce` at the start of each state-mutating entrypoint, with a view that exposes `replay_protection::get_nonce` (or `peek_next_nonce`) as `get_replay_nonce(actor, channel)`.

## Cross-Contract Isolation

Nonce state is stored in each contract's **instance storage** keyed by `ReplayKey::Nonce(Address, u32)`. Instance storage in Soroban is scoped to the contract ID — two independently deployed contracts, even if compiled from the same WASM binary, hold completely separate storage namespaces.

Practical implications:

- **A signed call replayed against a different contract** will encounter that contract's independent nonce stream. Each contract independently enforces its own counter; there is no shared global nonce registry.
- **The same admin address** that administers multiple contracts holds a **separate** nonce stream on every contract. Off-chain clients must query `get_replay_nonce(actor, channel)` per target contract and must not share a single counter across contracts.
- **Cross-contract nonce exhaustion is not possible.** Consuming nonce N on Contract A does not affect Contract B's counter for the same actor and channel.

See Block 1 of `contracts/common/src/replay_protection_test.rs` for tests that establish this isolation property concretely.

## Attack Scenarios and Defenses

The table below covers the full set of replay attack variants that the nonce scheme is designed to prevent. Each attack is verified by the test suite.

| Attack type | Description | Expected outcome |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Simple replay** | Re-submit a previously used nonce on the same contract, same actor, same channel | `panic!("nonce mismatch for actor/channel pair")` — stored nonce unchanged |
| **Cross-channel replay** | Submit a nonce that is current or stale on channel A to channel B of the same actor | Panic — channels are independent key dimensions; each channel maintains its own counter |
| **Cross-actor replay** | Submit actor A's nonce value for a call authorised by actor B | Panic — actors are independent key dimensions; the lookup returns B's counter, not A's |
| **Cross-contract replay** | Route a signed call intended for Contract A to Contract B | Panic — per-contract instance storage is fully isolated; B has no knowledge of A's nonces |
| **Brute-force guessing** | Enumerate nonce values to find the current one | Every incorrect guess panics; the stored counter is unchanged after each failed guess (no write on failure) |
| **Man-in-the-middle substitution** | Intercept a call and replace the nonce with `current - 1` (stale) or `current + 1` (skip-ahead) | Panic on both variants — only the exact current value is accepted |

### Why failed calls do not advance the nonce

`verify_and_increment_nonce` checks `provided == current` with `assert!` before performing any storage write. On mismatch the function panics immediately; the `set` call is never reached. Soroban rolls back all storage writes within a panicking call frame, so the counter is guaranteed to be unchanged after any failed verification.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Per-call cost**: each `verify_and_increment_nonce` performs exactly **1 storage read** and, on success, **1 storage write**. A failed call (panic path) performs only the read.
- **Complexity**: O(1) with respect to the total number of actors, channels, or nonces ever stored. There is no global registry, no linked list, and no iteration.
- **Storage key**: `ReplayKey::Nonce(Address, u32)` serialises to a fixed-size byte sequence used as a direct flat-map key in Soroban instance storage. Lookup cost is constant regardless of storage size.
- **Gas implication**: protecting a contract entrypoint with a nonce check adds exactly **2 ledger entry operations** (1 read + 1 write) to the call's resource cost, regardless of how many other actors or channels exist on the same contract.

## Test Coverage Summary

`contracts/common/src/replay_protection_test.rs` contains 32 tests in total.

**Original 12 tests** — basic nonce lifecycle:

- Nonce starts at zero and increments correctly
- Replay with the same nonce panics
- Skipped nonce panics
- Independent nonces per actor, per channel
- Overflow guard at `u64::MAX`
- Concurrent actors on the same channel
- `peek_next_nonce` consistency
- Backward (negative-direction) nonce rejection
- Multi-channel independence stress test
- Large nonce values near `u64::MAX`

**New 20 tests** — cross-contract replay attack simulation (organised in 7 blocks):

| Block | Tests | Coverage focus |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1 — Cross-contract storage isolation | 4 | Two contract instances; independent ledgers; diverging sequences |
| 2 — Cross-channel replay attacks | 3 | Admin/business channel confusion; stale and future nonce cross-apply |
| 3 — Cross-actor replay / confusion | 3 | Actor A nonce for actor B; coincident nonce values; 5-actor stress |
| 4 — Multi-step attack simulations | 3 | Captured transaction replay; brute-force guessing; MITM substitution |
| 5 — Cross-contract orchestration | 3 | Same admin on two contracts; routing error; 12-stream isolation matrix |
| 6 — Regression and determinism | 3 | Context-switch stability; exact-value determinism; state unchanged after attacks |
| 7 — Performance annotation | 1 | O(1) lookup with 50 actors; gas characteristics documented |
