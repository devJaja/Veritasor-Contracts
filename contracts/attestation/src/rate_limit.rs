//! # Rate Limiting for Attestation Submissions
//!
//! Configurable, per-business rate limiting to prevent abuse and spam
//! submissions. Uses a sliding-window model plus a shorter burst window:
//! each business can submit at most `max_submissions` attestations within
//! any `window_seconds` span, and at most `burst_max_submissions`
//! attestations within any `burst_window_seconds` span.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! On every submission the contract:
//!
//! 1. Loads the business's stored timestamps (`Vec<u64>`).
//! 2. Prunes any entries older than `now - window_seconds`.
//! 3. Counts active entries in the full window.
//! 4. Counts active entries in the shorter burst window.
//! 5. If the full-window count is already at the limit, panics with
//!    `"rate limit exceeded"`.
//! 6. If the burst-window count is already at the limit, panics with
//!    `"burst rate limit exceeded"`.
//! 7. After the attestation is successfully stored, records the current
//!    timestamp.
//!
//! ## Configuration Bounds
//!
//! To prevent misconfiguration and bound on-chain storage growth:
//!
//! - `max_submissions` must be in `[1, MAX_SUBMISSIONS_LIMIT]`.
//! - `window_seconds` must be in `[1, MAX_WINDOW_SECONDS]`.
//! - `burst_max_submissions` must be in `[1, max_submissions]`.
//! - `burst_window_seconds` must be in `[1, window_seconds]`.
//!
//! These bounds ensure the per-business timestamp vector never exceeds
//! `MAX_SUBMISSIONS_LIMIT` entries, keeping storage costs predictable.
//!
//! ## Clock Skew
//!
//! Soroban ledger timestamps are set by validators and advance
//! monotonically within a single ledger sequence. The sliding-window
//! cutoff uses `saturating_sub` so a zero-valued timestamp (e.g. in
//! tests) never underflows. Callers must not assume sub-second precision.
//!
//! ## Backward Compatibility
//!
//! If no `RateLimitConfig` has been stored, or if
//! `RateLimitConfig.enabled == false`, no limits are enforced.
//!
//! ## Security Notes
//!
//! - Storage keys are scoped per-business via `DataKey::SubmissionTimestamps`.
//!   Cross-business interference is impossible.
//! - `check_rate_limit` must be called **before** writing attestation data
//!   and `record_submission` **after** a successful write. Reversing this
//!   order would allow a submission to be recorded even if the write fails.
//! - All public functions are pure with respect to auth: they do not call
//!   `require_auth`. Auth is the caller's responsibility (see `lib.rs`).
